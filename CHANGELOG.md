# Changelog

## 2026-06-29

- Changed community contributions to an issue-only model and added a pull request template that redirects unrequested PRs to the issue templates.
- Added community readiness governance files, issue templates, contribution guidance, security policy, known limitations, maintenance plan, product aliases, data quality roadmap, and launch announcement draft.
- Added a public correction workflow in the app so users can open a prefilled GitHub issue for the selected error.
- Added launch-readiness smoke checks and data quality checks for source URLs, products, source types, aliases, and issue-template presence.
- Added public disclaimer and safety language for production changes.
- Added catalog lazy loading after the app shell mounts and disabled modulepreload for catalog chunks.
- Normalized the Forms `LFF502-UnexpectedError` aggregate entry so its scenario branches count in repeated-code reporting.
- Cleared the validation queue and documented the remaining roadmap: thin products, repeated-code scenarios, and official-doc baseline entries.
