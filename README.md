## How To Use It Safely

1. Search by error code, message text, product, symptom, or source detail.
2. Check the product, version, source confidence, fix status, and validation status.
3. Open the linked source before applying a fix.
4. Validate changes in a test or maintenance window before changing production.
5. Treat database, IIS, certificate, service-account, and security-baseline changes as change-controlled work.

## Source Priority

1. Official Laserfiche documentation.
2. Laserfiche Answers replies from Laserfiche employees.
3. Accepted or corroborated Laserfiche Answers community replies.
4. Community-only diagnostic reports.
