## Top Validation Candidates

| Product | Code | Fix status | Confidence | Best source | Title |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Review Rules

- Prioritize low-confidence entries that have Laserfiche employee or official documentation sources.
- Upgrade an entry only when the source supports the symptom, cause, and fix for the product/version context.
- Add scenario variants when the same code has different causes or fixes.
- Keep unresolved diagnostic entries visible when they help users identify the error but do not imply a confirmed fix.
- Catalog data is already split into Vite chunks for errors, reviewed sources, official docs, and vendor code; keep large new datasets in separate importable modules.
- If product-level lazy loading is implemented later, start with the largest products in the Product-Level Lazy Load Candidates section.
